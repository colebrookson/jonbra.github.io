My current research project is about understanding the significance of non-coding RNAs in the evolution of multicellular animals.


Check out our latest work on [microRNAs in the unicellular ancestors of animals](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31063-7#%20), 
and on the [cellular development of _Sphaeroforma arctica_](/publications/01-2019-Sar_development/)"
