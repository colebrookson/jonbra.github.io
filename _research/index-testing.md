One of my interests is the early evolution of animals. How did the first animal look like, and how did it evolve from single-celled species? In particular I am interested in genes that *regulate* how other genes are used and how these may have contributed to the evolution of increased morphological and developmental complexity. Species I am currently studying are sponges, comb jellies and the single-celled choanozoans, the closest ancestors of animals. 

## Regulatory RNA

### micro RNAs
micro RNAs are short RNA molecules that regulate other genes and are essential in animals. I am trying to find out when micro RNAs and the complementary protein machinery evolved in animals. Recently we have discovered for the first time micro RNAs in choanozoan species. The paper is not published, but you can check out the pre print on [bioRxiv.](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/01/076190)

### Long non-coding RNAs
Another type of regulatory genes are long non-coding RNAs. This is a class of recently discovered RNA genes. Very little is known about their functional roles (if any), and even less is known about their evolutionary significance. We are studying the developmental expression of lncRNAs in the earliest evolving animals, the sponges ([published in Proceedings B](publications/02-2015-proceedings.md)) and the comb jellies.
